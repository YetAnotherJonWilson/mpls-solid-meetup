This is an example project to demonstrate using the Inrupt Solid React SDK to build a web application, using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and typescript.
The example project is a sample application for editing user profile. You can play with the application at [https://solid-ui-react-example.docs.inrupt.com/](https://solid-ui-react-example.docs.inrupt.com/).


## Getting Started

To modify the application:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
    npm ci && npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

4. You can start editing the source files.  The application auto-updates as you edit the source files in `pages` and `components` folders.
